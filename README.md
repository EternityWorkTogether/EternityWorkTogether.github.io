# unblock-survivio
This is a GitHub repo that uses an iframe to bypass a Chrome extension that blocks games and stuff. My fellow students are particulary fond of Surviv.io, but the extension blocked the websites for it. Some websites worked, but fullscreen didn't work.
<br>
The solution? Make something that can bypass it.
<br>

So I did.

## This will not work with devices that use the Securly VPN, such as iPads and iPhones.
This will, however, work with the Chrome extension. It’s made for the extension and tested on the extension, so if your device doesn’t have it, it may not work.
