<p>This is a GitHub repo that uses an iframe to bypass a Chrome extension that blocks games and stuff. My fellow students are particulary fond of Surviv.io, but the extension blocked the websites for it. Some websites worked, but fullscreen didn't work. <br> The solution? Make something that can bypass it. <br></p>
<p>So I did.</p>

<p>This will, however, work with the Chrome extension. It’s made for the extension and tested on the extension, so if your device doesn’t have it, it may not work.</p>
